# Goatlings Accessibility Mod

## What is this?
This is a user script that adds some accessibility features to make more repetitive parts of [Goatlings](https://goatlings.com) able to use via keyboard


## What sections does it effect?
As of right now, it works in Explore Areas, Battles, and the Higher or Lower game. Support for other modes is on the way!

## How do I install it?
First, if install the [Greasemonkey extension on Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) or [Tampermonkey on Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo//Open). Then go to [Greasy Fork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/411537-goatlings-accessibility-mod) and click the install button. Then follow the instructions to complete installation!

## How do I know it's working?
Go to one of the supported sections of the site, and you will see a green tag in the top left that reads "Shortcuts Active".
